# TV Show Search
In the TV Show Search app, it allows users to type in a keyword or phrase and, with the click of the search button, would output the cover art images for the TV shows matching the inputted text.

This project is from Colt Steele's awesome Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy. However, a feature I added is the reset button, which would completely clear all currently displayed images and clear the text field.

In addition, I added in a feature that, when a new search term is inputted and the search button is pressed, would clear all images before completing the search and displaying the new images matching with the new search term. Before this was implemented, the application would simply just search and add the new images after the current images. This makes the application easier to use since a new search query should call for new search results.
